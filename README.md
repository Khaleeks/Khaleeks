# أهلاً وسهلاً 🤗

## Who am I?? 🇹🇹🧕🏾
I’m a proud Trini and a current student at NYUAD, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Interactive Media. I have a strong passion for Software Development and AI, and I enjoy building websites—sometimes just for fun, but mostly for assignments. Lately, I’ve been diving into deep learning and machine learning, especially with the rise of LLMs (Large Language Models), and I’m eager to stay ahead of the curve. Oh, and I can’t forget—I absolutely love the beach! 🌴

## 🔭 I’m currently working on 
Currently, I’m working as a research assistant with Sanad Lab on some fascinating projects focused on software development and improving the lives of software developers. At the same time, I’m deepening my skills in Unity and game design, which are passions of mine. As I explore XR and other emerging tech, I’m focusing on strengthening my understanding of VR, ensuring I stay versatile in the field. I’m passionate about blending my creativity from Interactive Media with a solution-oriented approach in Computer Science to explore new possibilities and tackle challenges.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning 
Right now, I’m diving deeper into Software Development, continuously building on my foundation and expanding my expertise in the field. Alongside that, I’ve developed a passion for Arabic, and I’m dedicating time to learning it more seriously. It’s been a rewarding challenge and has quickly become a favorite pursuit, keeping me quite busy. On the tech side, I’m starting to explore the world of deep learning and venturing beyond what I know in TensorFlow. I’m particularly interested in learning about different frameworks and techniques in machine learning to broaden my understanding and become more proficient in the space. As I explore these areas, I'm eager to tackle new problems and keep pushing my skills to the next level.

##  🤔 I’m looking for help with 
ANYTHING!, I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills! I'm very willing to learn and pick things up quickly, whether it's a new technology, framework, or concept. If there's something I don't know yet, I'm eager to dive in and master it—just give me the right resources, and I’m all in (except if it's math then respectfully, no thank you)!

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
I can code with one hand while eating pizza with the other. Multi-tasking at its finest!
